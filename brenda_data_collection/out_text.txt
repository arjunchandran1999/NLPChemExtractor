| we used the mean genetic distance (d = 0.036) of two Sesarma species group
comparisons. In each comparison, the genetic distance was determined for
species on either side of the Isthmus of Panama. For the reticulatum group, this
was 8. rhizophorae versus S. reticulatum, S. curacaoense, and S. sp. (nr.
reticulatum), d = 0.031 (16S rRNA, 0.020; COI, 0.041). For the sulcatum
‘| group, this was S. crassipes versus S. sulcatum and S. aequatoriale; d = 0.042
(16S rRNA, 0.021; COI, 0.062). These trans-isthmian species of intertidal and
| supratidal crabs presumably have not been isolated for more than 3.1 Myr (refs
| 19, 20). The resulting average rate of pairwise sequence divergence (which
| equals the non-Jamaican rate) was 1.17% per Myr (0.65% for 16S rRNA and
L 66% for COI, if analysed separately).
| Themean genetic distance between the Jamaican lineage and the reticulatum
_ group is 0.063 + 0.005 (s.e.m.). A relative rate test” revealed a distance of 0.037
“onthe Jamaican lineage and 0.026 on the reticulatum group lineage. The time of
' divergence between the two lineages (4.54 + 0.42 Myr) was estimated on the
‘reticulatum group lineage by applying the non-Jamaican rate; the standard
error of the divergence times is the standard error of the mean genetic distance
divided by this rate. That time estimate (4.54 Myr), in turn, was used to
alibrate the rate of pairwise sequence divergence within the Jamaican lineage
(1.63% per Myr; 0.88% for 16S rRNA and 2.33% for COI) and estimate
divergence times among species (Fig. 2) from the length of internal branches in
fig. 1. A nearly identical time estimate (4.56 Myr) for the origin of the Jamaican
lineage was obtained if a gamma correction'® (a = 1.5) was used to account for
fate variation among sites. In two other decapod crustacean studies, estimated
tates of pairwise sequence divergence for these two genes were higher: 2.2% per
 Myrfor 16S rRNA in hermit crabs”! and 2.2—2.6% per Myr for COI in snapping
shrimps~. Although the rate calibrated within Sesarma is preferred, application
| of those independent rates would result in an even more recent time estimate
| (2.4-2.9 Myr ago) for the origin of the Jamaican lineage.

The biosynthetic pathway of
vitamin C in higher plants

Glen L. Wheeler, Mark A. Jones & Nicholas Smirnoff

School of Biological Sciences, University of Exeter, Hatherly Laboratories,
Prince of Wales Road, Exeter EX4 4PS, UK

Vitamin C (1-ascorbic acid) has important antioxidant and metabolic functions in both plants and animals, but humans, and a few
other animal species, have lost the capacity to synthesize it’. Plantderived ascorbate is thus the major source of vitamin C in the
human diet. Although the biosynthetic pathway of L-ascorbic acid
in animals is well understood’, the plant pathway has remained
unknown’—one of the few primary plant metabolic pathways
for which this is the case. L-ascorbate is abundant in plants (found
at concentrations of 1-5mM in leaves and 25mM _ in
chloroplasts’*) and may have roles in photosynthesis and transmembrane electron transport’. We found that p-mannose and
.-galactose are efficient precursors for ascorbate synthesis and are
interconverted by GDP-p-mannose-3,5-epimerase. We have identified an enzyme in pea and Arabidopsis thaliana, 1-galactose
dehydrogenase, that catalyses oxidation of 1-galactose to 1-galactono1,4-lactone. We propose an ascorbate biosynthesis pathway involving
GDP-p-mannose, GDP-1-galactose, 1-galactose and 1-galactono1,4-lactone, and have synthesized ascorbate from GDP-p-mannose
by way of these intermediates in vitro. The definition of this
biosynthetic pathway should allow engineering of plants for
increased ascorbate production, thus increasing their nutritional
value and stress tolerance.

Evidence for the ascorbate-biosynthesis pathways so far proposed
for plants is inconclusive. The most effective exogenous precursor of
t-ascorbic acid is 1-galactono-1,4-lactone, which is converted
directly to ascorbate by a mitochondrial enzyme, 1-galactono-1,4lactone dehydrogenase®’. However, the role of 1-galactono-1,4lactone as a physiological precursor has been disputed’. 1-galactono-1,4-lactone has not been detected in plants and, more significantly, its proposed production by p-galacturonic acid’ requires
inversion of the hexose carbon skeleton, which extensive radiolabel
tracer studies have shown does not occur during ascorbate synthesis
from glucose’. An alternative pathway, involving the unusual
intermediates p-glucosone and 1-sorbosone, has been suggested";
this pathway involves no inversion of the carbon chain. However,
the evidence that the physiological precursors are osones is also not
conclusive.

If plants could produce 1-galactono-1,4-lactone without inver
‘sion of the carbon chain, evidence for its involvement in ascorbate

biosynthesis would be more powerful. To investigate the possible
source of L-galactono-1,4-lactone in plants, we supplied 1-galactose
to barley leaf slices. This resulted in a rapid and substantial increase
in the foliar ascorbate concentration, similar to that induced by t
365

 
letters to nature

galactono-1,4-lactone (Fig. la), Feeding with 1-galactose also
increased ascorbate concentration in A. thaliana leaves and embryonic

_ axes of germinating pea seedlings. The identity of the product as L_ ascorbate was confirmed by its reactivity with ascorbate oxidase, by
_ its ability to reduce acidic dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP), and

by co-chromatography with t-ascorbate using thin-layer chromato
graphy (TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography

 

 

(HPLC). Exogenous t-galactose accumulated in pea embryonic
axes. The i-galactose was undetectable by gas chromatography
(GC) th after removal of the external supply, showing that it is
rapidly and efficiently metabolized.

L-galactose is therefore an effective precursor of 1-ascorbate in
plants. Oxidation of t-galactose at position C1 would result in the
production of 1-galactono-1,4-lactone. An enzyme catalyzing this
reaction was detected in cell-free extracts of A. thaliana leaves and
pea embryonic axes. Both of these extracts supported L-galactosedependent reduction of NAD*. The enzyme activity from pea
embryonic axes was partially purified. The reduction activity with
NADP* was 10% of that with NAD*. The enzyme exhibited no

-fucose and p-arabinose. The reaction product showed a positive
response with the hydroxylamine assay for lactones, with 1:1
stoichiometry between NADH formation and lactone production
(in 1-galactono-1,4-lactone equivalents). We purified the reaction
product and subjected it to GC-mass spectrometry (MS) to distinguish between two possible reaction products (C6 oxidation results
in a uronic acid or lactone, whereas Cl oxidation results in an
aldonic acid or lactone). We detected one peak, which co-chromatographed with authentic L-galactono-1,4-lactone. Its mass spectrum was identical to that of 1-galactono-1,4-lactone. We assume
that the initial product, from 1-galactopyranose, was 1-galactono|5-lactone which is relatively unstable and spontaneously converts
to the 1,4 lactone. The K,, for 1-galactose was 0.3 mM (Fig. 1b). The
4 enzyme oxidized L-sorbosone, another suggested intermediate in
\ plant ascorbate biosynthesis'’, but with very low affinity (Fig. 1b).
’ Thisactivity had a similar preference for NAD". The product would
) be t-ascorbate acid'’, explaining the incorporation of labelled Lsorbosone into ascorbate'’. 1-sorbosone has the same configuration
a i-galactose at C4 and C5 and the chiral centre at C3 is lost in
ascorbate.
We have therefore demonstrated the existence of a new higherplant enzyme, 1-galactose dehydrogenase (1-galactose:NADP’ oxidoreductase), which forms 1-galactono-1,4-lactone from 1-galactose with high affinity and specificity. Other dehydrogenases that
oxidize C1 of non-phosphorylated aldoses have been identified, for
example p-galactose dehydrogenase in Pseudomonas fluorescens’? L_ fucose dehydrogenase in mammals" and fungi’? and p-arabinose
_ dehydrogenase in Candida albicans'*. The latter enzyme has been
implicated in synthesis of p-arabino-1,4-lactone, which is the
precursor of p-erythroascorbate, the yeast analogue of t-ascorbate'®.

GDP-p-[U-'*C]mannose (universally labelled GDP-p-mannose) as _|
substrate. The products were free t-galactose and one or more acidic |

compounds, which produced t-galactose after hydrolysis. These
acidic compounds must be GDP-1-galactose and/or 1-galactose-1
phosphate (Fig. 2a, b). We confirmed the identity of the non-acidic |

product as 1-galactose, rather than p-galactose, by its lack of
reactivity with p-galactose dehydrogenase™. 1-galactose is formed

by hydrolysis of GDP-1-galactose; we do not yet know if1-galactose- |

1-phosphate is an intermediate. We suggest that formation of 1
galactose resulted from a specific hydrolytic activity, because very

little free mannose was released from GDP-mannose (Fig. 2b).
NAD* added to the reaction mixture during the latter part of the

incubation period resulted in loss of .-galactose from the neutral |
sugar fraction and appearance of radioactivity in a compound with |
the same mobility as 1-galactono-1,4-lactone (Fig. 2c). Therefore, |
to confirm that 1-galactono-1,4-lactone was produced from GDP- |

mannose, we prepared a pea embryonic axis extract containing
intact mitochondria. Assays were carried out as above but with the
addition of cytochrome c (1.5 mg ml ') as an electron acceptor for
t-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase*’. We added unlabelled

carrier ascorbate to the reaction mixture and then separated |

ascorbate by ion-exchange chromatography followed by TLC or
HPLC. A radioactive peak that co-chromatographed with
carrier L-ascorbate was detected in both systems. Treatment with
ascorbate oxidase removed the radiolabelled HPLC peak. This
clearly shows the ability of the tissue extract to produce ascorbate
from GDP-p-mannose.

D-mannose is not extensively metabolized through glycolysis in
plants and is instead mainly used in production of nucleotide sugar
intermediates which are precursors for polysaccharides and
glycoproteins'’, Exogenous mannose is readily phosphorylated to
mannose-6-phosphate'’*’. To confirm that the proposed biosynthetic pathway occurs in vivo, we fed p-[U-"'C]mannose to A.
thaliana leaves and compared its incorporation into ascorbate
with incorporation of p-(U-''C]| glucose (Fig. 3, Table 1). In agreement with earlier reports'’''**, 1% of the labelled glucose was
converted to ascorbate. In contrast, 10% of the labelled mannose
was incorporated into ascorbate, showing that this is a major
metabolic fate for this sugar. The same result was found with
marrow (Cucurbita pepo) roots. High concentrations of exogenous
mannose did not affect ascorbate pool size, indicating that its
conversion to L-galactose may be more rate-limiting than oxidation
of L-galactose and 1-galactono-1,4-lactone to produce ascorbate.

These results allow us to propose a pathway for ascorbate
biosynthesis in higher plants that is consistent with earlier evidence
(Fig. 4). We have demonstrated the ability of plant extracts to
catalyse all the proposed reactions, including 1-galactose oxidation

| by 1-galactose dehydrogenase, a new enzyme in higher plants. The

pathway reconciles the apparent contradiction between the ease of
oxidation of t-galactono-1,4-lactone to ascorbate and earlier radiolabelling data. Pioneering work showed that, during conversion of
p-glucose to ascorbate in plants, there is conservation of the
hydroxymethyl group at C6, an epimerization at C5 and no
inversion of the carbon chain*'’''. Our pathway, in which Lgalactono-1,4-lactone is produced from p-glucose and p-mannose
through GDP-p-mannose and t-galactose, is consistent with these
requirements. We suggest that the ability of plants to incorporate
radiolabel from the osones (p-glucosone and 1-sorbosone) into
ascorbate also agrees with this scheme'’.

L-sorbosone is a substrate analogue for i-galactose dehydrogenase
(Fig. 1b). The very low affinity ‘1-sorbosone-dehydrogenase’ activity previously reported’ could therefore be t-galactose dehydrogenase. However, this sorbosone-dehydrogenase activity, in contrast
to 1-galactose dehydrogenase, had a preference for NADP” over
NAD* (ref. 12). The relationship between these activities requires
investigation. More speculatively, if exogenous p-glucosone were
reduced at position C2, about 50% of the product would be pmannose which explains its incorporation into ascorbate'”.

Identification of the ascorbate-biosynthesis pathway fills a major
gap in plant carbohydrate metabolism, as up to 10% of the soluble
carbohydrate content of leaves can be t-ascorbate. We are now ina
position to investigate the subcellular localization and control of
ascorbate biosynthesis in plants and, ultimately, to manipulate its
content with potential benefits for human nutrition and plant
resistance to oxidative stress. An ascorbate-deficient A. Thaliana
mutant (vtcl, formerly known as soz!) has been isolated”; this
mutant is affected in ascorbate biosynthesis”. vtcl, and other
biosynthesis mutants, will be valuable for testing the proposed
pathway.

Visual input evokes transient
and strong shunting inhibition
invisual cortical neurons

The function and nature of inhibition of neurons in the visual
cortex have been the focus of both experimental and theoretical
Investigations’ ’. There are two ways in which inhibition can
‘Suppress synaptic excitation™*. In hyperpolarizing inhibition,
hegative and positive currents sum linearly to produce a net
change in membrane potential. In contrast, shunting inhibition
acts nonlinearly by causing an increase in membrane conductance; this divides the amplitude of the excitatory response.
Visually evoked changes in membrane conductance have been
Teported to be nonsignificant or weak, supporting the hyperetn mode of inhibition®’". Here we present a new
pproach to studying inhibition that is based on in vivo wholeell voltage clamping. This technique allows the continuous
Measurement of conductance dynamics during visual activation.
We show, in neurons of cat primary visual cortex, that the
F¢sponse to optimally orientated flashed bars can increase the
Somatic input conductance to more than three times that of the
Testing state. The short latency of the visually evoked peak of
onductance, and its apparent reversal potential suggest a domifant contribution from y-aminobutyric acid ((GABA),) receptormediated synapses. We propose that nonlinear shunting inhibifon may act during the initial stage of visual cortical processing,
Setting the balance between opponent ‘On’ and ‘Off? responses in
different locations of the visual receptive field.

[ Tn the visual cortex, there are two major types of receptive fields,
Simple’ and ‘complex’, based partly on the degree of spatial overlap
Setween On and Off responses (evoked by an increase or decrease in
Light contrast, respectively) in the visual field*'’. Simple receptive
elds have distinct On and Off subfields, whereas these are over

lapping in complex cells. We can consider how intracortical inhibition works during visual cortical processing at different levels. At the
functional level, inhibition could help in the push—pull organization of opponent responses (for example, hyperpolarization is
evoked by a decrease in light contrast in the On subfield) seen in
simple receptive fields*. It could also control the spatial tuning of On
and Off excitation, as intracortical blockade of y-aminobutyric acid
(GABA), receptors results in loss of segregation of On and Off
excitatory responses in simple cells, whether measured extracellularly' or intracellularly".

At the biophysical level, even if shunting inhibition does exist,
there is still a quantitative issue concerning its functional importance. As the reversal potential for GABA,-mediated channels,
which are probably responsible for the shunt in membrane conductance, is near the resting potential, shunting inhibition must
produce a large change in the postsynaptic conductance to significantly counteract excitation. Simulations show that this shunt
should be visible as a 100—200% increase in the somatic input
conductance, G;,(t), relative to the no-stimulus condition (characterized as Gane: However, measurements from current clamp
recordings have indicated limited conductance changes (relative

Figure 1 The visually evoked relative change in input conductance AG;,(t) and its
apparent reversal potential E,.(t) are derived from the current waveforms
measured by two to four voltage-clamp protocols, illustrated here for the
subthreshold response of an end-stopped simple cell to an Off transition of a
flashing bar (full response is shown in Fig. 2e, cell 4, position 8). a, Voltage

holding potential corrected for R,. The interpolated voltage at zero current of the
//V characteristic at any given time predicts the current clamp response (Vin(t) inc.
The stability of the recording, and the justification of a linear approximation for this
subthreshold example, are shown by the close match between the original and
the interpolated traces superimposed in a. d, Relative AG;,(t), derived continuously over the complete duration of the visual stimulation. e, E,.,(t). f, Phase

over 1 ms, illustrating the various trajectories in time (arrow for time 7). In this case,
the conductance response at time 0 is >105% of the input conductance at rest
because the tail of the On response starts 1000 ms earlier. All responses in this
paper are averages of 10 trials.
