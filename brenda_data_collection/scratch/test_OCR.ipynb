Visual input evokes transient and strong shunting inhibition invisual cortical neurons  Lyle J. Borg-Graham, Cyril Monier & Yves Frégnac  _ Equipe Cognisciences, Institut Alfred Fessard, CNRS, Avenue de la Terrasse, 91198 Gif sur Yvette, France  The function and nature of inhibition of neurons in the visual cortex have been the focus of both experimental and theoretical Investigations’ ’. There are two ways in which inhibition can ‘Suppress synaptic excitation™*. In hyperpolarizing inhibition, hegative and positive currents sum linearly to produce a net change in membrane potential. In contrast, shunting inhibition acts nonlinearly by causing an increase in membrane conductance; this divides the amplitude of the excitatory response. Visually evoked changes in membrane conductance have been Teported to be nonsignificant or weak, supporting the hyperetn mode of inhibition®’\". Here we present a new pproach to studying inhibition that is based on in vivo wholeell voltage clamping. This technique allows the continuous Measurement of conductance dynamics during visual activation. We show, in neurons of cat primary visual cortex, that the F¢sponse to optimally orientated flashed bars can increase the Somatic input conductance to more than three times that of the Testing state. The short latency of the visually evoked peak of onductance, and its apparent reversal potential suggest a domifant contribution from y-aminobutyric acid ((GABA),) receptormediated synapses. We propose that nonlinear shunting inhibifon may act during the initial stage of visual cortical processing, Setting the balance between opponent ‘On’ and ‘Off? responses in different locations of the visual receptive field.  [ Tn the visual cortex, there are two major types of receptive fields, Simple’ and ‘complex’, based partly on the degree of spatial overlap Setween On and Off responses (evoked by an increase or decrease in Light contrast, respectively) in the visual field*\\'’. Simple receptive elds have distinct On and Off subfields, whereas these are over                                                        |VOL 393/28 MAY 1998  letters to nature  lapping in complex cells. We can consider how intracortical inhibition works during visual cortical processing at different levels. At the functional level, inhibition could help in the push—pull organization of opponent responses (for example, hyperpolarization is evoked by a decrease in light contrast in the On subfield) seen in simple receptive fields*. It could also control the spatial tuning of On and Off excitation, as intracortical blockade of y-aminobutyric acid (GABA), receptors results in loss of segregation of On and Off excitatory responses in simple cells, whether measured extracellularly\\' or intracellularly\".  At the biophysical level, even if shunting inhibition does exist, there is still a quantitative issue concerning its functional importance. As the reversal potential for GABA,-mediated channels, which are probably responsible for the shunt in membrane conductance, is near the resting potential, shunting inhibition must produce a large change in the postsynaptic conductance to significantly counteract excitation. Simulations show that this shunt should be visible as a 100—200% increase in the somatic input conductance, G;,(t), relative to the no-stimulus condition (characterized as Gane: However, measurements from current clamp recordings have indicated limited conductance changes (relative  a 70 c 1000 t=T Rest A Vn (mV) Vn In (PA) -80 i +90 0 Erey (1) b rev I, i NM ame .
